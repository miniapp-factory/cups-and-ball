+Code the following app
+```
+App Name: Find the Ball
+
+Create a simple Cup and Ball guessing game where three cups are shown on the screen and a ball is hidden under one of them. The cups are shuffled randomly, and the player must guess which cup contains the ball. After the player selects a cup, reveal whether their guess is correct or not. Include smooth cup-shuffling animation, sound effects for correct and wrong guesses, and a replay option. The style should be fun, colorful, and easy for beginners to understand.
+
+Let the player choose a difficulty level:
+-Easy: Slow shuffle, 3 shuffles
+-Medium: Faster shuffle, 5 shuffles
+-Hard: Very fast shuffle, 8–10 shuffles
+
+-Shuffle the cups based on the chosen difficulty with smooth animations.
+-Allow the player to tap a cup to guess where the ball is.
+-Reveal if the guess is correct or wrong.
+-Track and display the player’s score.
+-Show a “Play Again” button after each round.
+-Use a colorful, minimalist, mobile-friendly design.”
